# TODO: Add Smooth Scrolling and Scroll-Triggered Animations

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Install GSAP and Lenis libraries via npm
- [x] Initialize Lenis smooth scrolling in src/main.jsx
- [x] Update src/App.jsx to add GSAP ScrollTrigger animations for each section (fade in on scroll)
- [x] Test the website for performance and smooth scrolling
- [x] Ensure no structure or content changes, only animations added

## Notes:
- Use Lenis for smooth scrolling to maintain high performance.
- Use GSAP ScrollTrigger for fade-in animations on each section without altering existing code.
- Sections to animate: Hero, About, Expertise, Experience, TherapeuticAreas, ToolsTechnologies, Contact.
- Optimized performance by removing hover scale on Hero image and eliminating framer-motion from Hero component.
